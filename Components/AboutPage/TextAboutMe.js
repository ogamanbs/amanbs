            Hi, I am Aman Bindiya Sharma, I am final year student, pusuing BTech in Computer Scinece and Engineering with specialization in Artificial Intelligence.
            Although, I am having my minor asArtificial Intelligence but I am more inclined towards web development. I use MERN (MongoDB, Express,js, React.js and Node.js) as my tech stack for full stack web development.
            I am learning System Design, and it astonishes me that how the BIG companies operate on such a great scale, their software cater to such a great variety and great number of users.
            I want to help organizations to build softwares that can cater a large userbase and learn the same to hone my skills and to be able to impact the whole world.
        </p>
